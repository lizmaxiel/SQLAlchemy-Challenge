# Honolulu, Hawaii Vacation Planning
  This was created as a guide to help plan for a relaxing holiday vacation. A comprehensive analysis was conducted within this region. The following sections detail the steps that were taken to achieve this. 

# Part 1: Climate data analysis and exploration
  This section used Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib. SQLAlchemy queries were used to analyze the region's climate patterns. 

# Part 2: Climate App Design
  By completing the initial part, the next step was to create a Flask API that uses the queries I created. In this section, custom routes will provide users with climate information regarding Honolulu, Hawaii.
